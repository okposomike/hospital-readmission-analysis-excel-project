# 🏥 Hospital Readmissions: Risk & Outcomes Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions are a major indicator of healthcare quality and cost efficiency.
This project analyzes **25,000 patient records** to identify patterns, risk factors, and outcomes associated with hospital readmissions using **Microsoft Excel**.

The goal is to help healthcare stakeholders understand **who is most likely to be readmitted and why**, using clear KPIs and an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

* Analyze patient characteristics linked to readmission
* Identify high-risk patient groups
* Summarize key hospital performance metrics
* Present insights in a **clear, decision-friendly dashboard**

---

## 🧾 Dataset Description

* **Source:** Hospital Readmission Dataset
* **Records:** 25,000 patients
* **Key Fields:**

  * Age range
  * Time in hospital
  * Number of medications
  * Emergency, inpatient, and outpatient visits
  * Diagnoses and medical specialty
  * Diabetes tests and medication changes
  * Readmission status (Yes/No)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following steps were performed in Excel:

* Preserved raw data integrity in a **Raw_Data** sheet
* Standardized categorical values (Yes/No → Binary)
* Split age ranges into:

  * Age Start
  * Age End
  * Age Midpoint
* Created stay categories:

  * Short Stay
  * Medium Stay
  * Long Stay
* Checked for blanks, duplicates, and inconsistencies

---

## 📊 Key KPIs

The dashboard highlights the following metrics:

* Total Patients
* Readmission Rate (%)
* Total Readmitted Patients
* Average Length of Stay
* % Long Stay Patients
* % Patients with Medication Changes

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features

* Interactive KPI cards
* Trend and comparison charts
* Age-based and utilization analysis
* Slicers for dynamic filtering
* Clean, executive-style layout

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Longer hospital stays are associated with higher readmission risk
* Patients with frequent emergency visits show increased likelihood of readmission
* Medication changes and diabetes treatment patterns influence outcomes
* Certain diagnoses and specialties contribute disproportionately to readmissions

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel

  * Pivot Tables
  * Formulas (IF, IFS, VALUE, FIND, LEFT, MID)
  * Charts & Slicers
  * Dashboard design

---

## 📁 Project Structure

* Raw_Data – Original dataset (unchanged)
* Cleaned_Data – Processed and structured data
* EDA – Exploratory analysis
* Dashboard – Final interactive dashboard

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Excel can be used for **end-to-end data analysis**, from cleaning and transformation to insight generation and dashboard reporting. It reflects practical skills required for a **junior data analyst role** in healthcare or operations analytics.
